          <section class="content"><p>January 1, 2019. The year started off with <strong>Bruce Weber</strong> and <strong>Joanne Pagano Weber</strong>‘s beautiful Alternative New Years Day poetry marathon—their last one in New York. We thank them for 25-years of devotion to community.<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Then my friend <strong>Carole Sorrel</strong> hooked me up with <strong>Albert Scaglione</strong>, the founder of <strong>Park West</strong>, the largest gallery in the world according to <em>The New York Times</em>. He wanted me to do a writing&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>By February first I was on a yearlong whirlwind that would take me to Detroit, Atlanta, Orlando, Miami, Amsterdam, Belgium, and the Caribbean. I met several artists working with <strong>Park West</strong> — <strong>Romero Britto, Lebo, Tim Yanke, Clare Sykes, Wyland</strong>, and <strong>Glenn Marcus</strong>. The father of Kinetic art, <strong>Yaacov Agam</strong> did my portrait in Paris! And I renewed my acquaintance with <strong>Leslie Lew</strong> who I knew from the bad old <span class="caps">EV</span>&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>Albert was a lot of fun to follow, full of vim, vinegar, vitality, and veritas. I loved scribing his wit and wisdom and made many new&nbsp;friends.</p>
<p>The <strong>Detroit Institute of Arts</strong> gave a group of us a tour thanks to Albert’s sister <strong>Diane Pandolfi</strong>. <strong>Ruben</strong> and <strong>Isabel Toledo</strong>‘s “Labor of Love” exhibit reimagined the museum with pieces they created that were inspired by the Institute’s collection and then placed in situ. I loved the surprise and incongruity — like strange doll figures in elaborate costumes sitting on a 300-year-old&nbsp;table.</p>
<p><img src="/articles/end-run-19/tyree.jpg" alt="pink junk sculpture on lawn">
Jeff and Tyree Guyton, Guyton public art,&nbsp;Detroit.</p>
<p>One morning the crew visited the <strong>Heidelberg Project</strong> by artist <strong>Tyree Guyton</strong>. The artworks sprawl across a once-vibrant section of Detroit in places where only a few homes are left. <strong>The Spotted House</strong> is the most recognizable landmark in the section that stretches for several blocks.
Back in New York, I got to meet the visionary artist at <strong>Martos Gallery</strong> for his opening. He’s continuing to build on his signature look, using a mix of fine art materials and recontextualized objects. “…Everything is connected to this one source of energy or this divine&nbsp;power.”</p>
<p>In the world of poetry and writing, the year brought several legends low. <strong>Steve Cannon</strong>, founder of <em>A Gathering of the Tribes</em>, opened his home and his heart to writers, artists, and musicians. He was feted by hundreds of friends and mourners in a second line parade that flounced and sashayed through the <span class="caps">EV</span>. “Love you madly.” <a href="https://livemag.org/pages/issue_9.htm#cannon">Live Mag #&nbsp;9</a></p>
<p><strong>Steve Dalachinsky</strong> turned off the light after reading for <em>A Book About Death</em> by <strong>Ray Johnson</strong>. Steve knew how to be a star. We send love to his partner of 40 years, <strong>Yuko Otomo</strong>. <em>Live Mag #2, 8,</em> <a href="https://livemag.org/issue_16/steve-dalachinsky/">16</a></p>
<p>And <strong>John Giorno</strong>, the great poly-artist who electrified audiences with his syle, slipped off while his show was up across the street at <strong>Sperone Westwater</strong>. Giorno Poetry Systems enlarged the audience for poetry. “You got to burn to shine.” <a href="https://livemag.org/issue_12/giorno.html">Live Mag #12</a> All sympathies to his partner, <strong>Ugo Rondinone</strong>.</p>
<p>Count your blessings, faithful readers, and&nbsp;shine.</p>
